
## 📌 Scientific Calculator using Python & Tkinter

### 🧮 Project Overview

This project is a **Graphical Scientific Calculator** developed using **Python Tkinter**. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with advanced mathematical functions like trigonometry, logarithms, square root, power, constants, and more. The GUI is designed to look modern and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
✔ Scientific functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `ln`, `sqrt`
✔ Constants: π (Pi), e
✔ Error handling for invalid operations
✔ Attractive UI with a dark-themed layout
✔ Easy to modify & extend
✔ Fully written in pure Python (no external libraries except standard `math`)
